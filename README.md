# Overview
Metier is a desktop career management application designed with JavaFX that is meant for both employers and employees. Employers can create job circular postings and search for prospective employees using a variety of search criteria such as educational backgrounds, specific skill sets, and so on. Job seekers, on the other hand, can search for potential job opportunities based on job type, required skills, salary ranges, and other factors. This is a functional offline system prototype that uses a local database but can be deployed as an online system by integrating with a cloud server rather than a local one.
